# ChirpStack certificates

This repository contains configuration to generate certificates for the
[ChirpStack](https://www.chirpstack.io/) project.

## Requirements

For generating the certificates, [cfssl](https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl)
is being used. Make sure you have this tool installed.

To modify the hosts using the `set-hosts` command you will need
[jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) installed.

## Modifying hosts

You can modify all `certificate.json` files at once with specific hosts with the
`set-hosts` command:

```
HOSTS=127.0.0.1,localhost,lns.example.com make set-hosts
```

## Generating certificates

Simply run `make` to generate all certificates. All certificates will be
written to the `certs` folder. See also the `Makefile` for all commands
being executed.

You probably want to make changes to the `certificate.json` files under
`config`. Please see [https://cfssl.org](https://cfssl.org) for documentation
about the `cfssl` usage.

## Generating certificates using docker

An alternate way to generate the certificates that does not require to have the
different dependencies installed is by using docker (you will need docker, of course).

```
docker-compose run -e HOSTS="127.0.0.1,localhost,lns.example.com" --rm chirpstack-certificates make set-hosts
docker-compose run --rm chirpstack-certificates make
```

Note: using docker can be also useful to run it along with the full ChirpStack stack and
share the generated certificates across the different services. 
The image accepts a HOSTS environment variable to change the `certificate.json` files
accordingly and takes care of recreating the certificates if that setting changes.

## Certificates

### certs/ca

Use the `ca.pem` "common authority" certificate for every API endpoint you wish
to secure using TLS. The `ca.pem` and `ca-key.pem` can also be used within the
ChirpStack Network Server and ChirpStack Application Server configuration for
generating gateway and MQTT client certificates.

### certs/chirpstack-network-server/api

These certificates are for securing the ChirpStack Network Server API which is by default
listening on port `8000` (see `chirpstack-network-server.toml` configuration file).

#### server

These are the certificates for the server-side of the API and must be
configured in `chirpstack-network-server.toml`. Example:

```toml
ca_cert="certs/ca/ca.pem"
tls_cert="certs/chirpstack-network-server/api/server/chirpstack-network-server-api-server.pem"
tls_key="certs/chirpstack-network-server/api/server/chirpstack-network-server-api-server-key.pem"
```

#### client

These are the client-side certificates (used by ChirpStack Application Server) to connect to
the ChirpStack API.

**Important:** the `CN` of the client certificate must match the `as_public_id`
of the ChirpStack Application Server instance (see `chirpstack-application-server.toml` configuration file)
using the generated certificate.

When creating a [Network server](https://www.chirpstack.io/application-server/use/network-servers/)
using the web-interface, you must enter the content of the following
files under *Certificates for ChirpStack Application Server to ChirpStack connection*:

* **CA certificate** content of `certs/ca/ca.pem`
* **TLS certificate** content of `certs/chirpstack-network-server/api/client/chirpstack-network-server-api-client.pem`
* **TLS key** content of `certs/chirpstack-network-server/api/client/chirpstack-network-server-api-client-key.pem`

### certs/chirpstack-application-server/api

These certificates are for securing the ChirpStack Application Server API which is by default
listening on port `8001` (see `chirpstack-application-server.toml`). This is not the REST API!

#### server

These are the certificates for the server-side of the API and must be configured
in `chirpstack-application-server.toml`. Example:

```toml
ca_cert="certs/ca/ca.pem"
tls_cert="certs/chirpstack-application-server/api/server/chirpstack-application-server-api-server.pem"
tls_key="certs/chirpstack-application-server/api/server/chirpstack-application-server-api-server-key.pem"
```

#### client

These are the client-side certificates (used by ChirpStack) to connect to the
ChirpStack Application Server API.

**Important:** the `CN` of the client certificate must match the `net_id`
of the ChirpStack instance using the certificate (see `chirpstack-network-server.toml`).

When creating a [Network server](https://www.chirpstack.io/application-server/use/network-servers/)
using the web-interface, you must enter the content of the following
files under *Certificates for ChirpStack to ChirpStack Application Server connection*:

* **CA certificate** content of `certs/ca/ca.pem`
* **TLS certificate** content of `certs/chirpstack-application-server/api/client/chirpstack-application-server-api-client.pem`
* **TLS key** content of `certs/chirpstack-application-server/api/client/chirpstack-application-server-api-client-key.pem`

### certs/chirpstack-application-server/join-api

These certificates are for securing the ChirpStack Application Server Join API which is by
default listening on port `8003` (see `chirpstack-application-server.toml`).

#### server

These are the certificates for the server-side of the Join API and must be
configured in `chirpstack-application-server.toml`. Example:

```toml
js_ca_cert="certs/ca/ca.pem"
js_tls_cert="certs/chirpstack-application-server/join-api/server/chirpstack-application-server-join-api-server.pem"
js_tls_key="certs/chirpstack-application-server/join-api/server/chirpstack-application-server-join-api-server-key.pem"
```

#### client

**Important:** the `CN` of the client certificate must match the `net_id`
of the ChirpStack instance using the certificate (see `chirpstack-network-server.toml`).

These are the client-side certificates (used by ChirpStack) to connect to the ChirpStack
Join API and must be configured in `chirpstack-network-server.toml`. Example:

```toml
js_ca_cert="certs/ca/ca.pem"
js_tls_cert="certs/chirpstack-application-server/join-api/client/chirpstack-application-server-join-api-client.pem"
js_tls_key="certs/chirpstack-application-server/join-api/client/chirpstack-application-server-join-api-client-key.pem"
```

### certs/mqtt

These certificates are for securing the MQTT broker used for the gateway to
ChirpStack Network Server communication and ChirpStack Application Server
MQTT integration.

#### server

These are the certificates that must be used for configuring your MQTT broker.
Please refer to the configuration documentation of your MQTT broker for more
information.

#### client

Client-certificates are generated by the ChirpStack Network Server and
ChirpStack Application Server.

##### ChirpStack Network Server

For enabling the support of generating client-certificates which can be used
by the ChirpStack Gateway Bridge to connect to the MQTT broker, you must
configure the following section in the `chirpstack-network-server.toml`
file:

```toml
[network_server.gateway]
ca_cert="certs/ca/ca.pem"
ca_key="certs/ca/ca-key.pem"
```

The generated client-certificate will contain the Gateway ID as `CN`. Most MQTT
broker support using the `CN` for authorization to specific MQTT topics. E.g.

```
pattern readwrite gateway/%u/#
```

##### ChirpStack Application Server

For enabling the support of generating client-certificates for the MQTT
integrations, you must configure the following section in the
`chirpstack-application-server.toml` file:

```toml
[application_server.integration.mqtt.client]
ca_cert="certs/ca/ca.pem"
ca_key="certs/ca/ca-key.pem"
```

The generated client-certificate will contain the application ID as `CN`. Most MQTT
broker support using the `CN` for authorization to specific MQTT topics. E.g.

```
pattern readwrite application/%u/#
```
